## Awesome Shop

This is a personal project I've used to learn more about react and serverless development. I used react (with hooks and styled components), redux and firebase to build the app.

It's deployed on heroku [here](https://awesome-shop-react.herokuapp.com) and can be downloaded as a Progressive Web App.
